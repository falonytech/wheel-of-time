                        Definition of Woke and Woke Ideology
                    </p>
                    <h3>Woke</h3>
                    <p class="blog_content-p">
                        To be awakened to the systemic oppression and discrimination throughout society’s social, cultural, and political 
                        institutions and systems. To be aware of how the functioning of these institutions and systems oppresses marginalized 
                        groups both historically and in the present.
                    </p>
                    <p class="blog_content-p">
                        To give a couple of examples:
                    </p>
                    <p class="blog_content-p">
                        Black people suffer from racism baked into the foundation of the culture and laws of the United States, and this baked in 
                        racism impacts their education, how they are treated by the law, career opportunities, etc. White Supremacy is pushed 
                        culturally, and dominates through the teaching of history, the movies that are made, the standards of beauty, the stories 
                        that are told, the music that is popular. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="blog_content-p">
                        Women have suffered throughout history, not being allowed to vote, own land, have jobs outside the home, married off to 
                        men, and generally viewed as second class citizens. Society, and all cultural, political, societal institutions and 
                        structures are patriarchal in nature and designed to oppress women. Women are pressured to fit into a gendered stereotype 
                        from birth, which places them in a supporting role to men, pushing them to earn less, focus on having babies and managing 
                        a home rather than focusing on a career and being a head of a household. 

                    </p>
                    <h3>Woke Ideology</h3>
                    <p class="blog_content-p">
                        Given the definition of Woke, Woke Ideology is the solutions and  the prescriptions designed to compensate and/or correct 
                        for the historic and current inequities present in said societal and political structures. 

                    </p>
                    <p class="blog_content-p">
                        This is where I will expand a little further in my examples, and they can be found throughout society. Woke Ideology sees 
                        the inequities and the root causes of these inequities throughout all facets of society, and so the prescriptions are 
                        pushed all throughout society. 

                    </p>
                    <p class="blog_content-p">
                        First example is the news media. News, for years, has been viewed primarily as an institution that reports the facts with 
                        as little bias as possible, and let the consumer of the news make a determination on what they believe. While this was not 
                        always the case, going back further when news papers were far more ideological, there was a change. Fast forward to today, 
                        and new media, regardless of format, is used as a vehicle for political messaging. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="blog_content-p">
                        In the 1990’s and early 2000’s, local news and national news frequently reported on crimes stories committed by black men. 
                        The nightly news was filled with these stories. Eventually, it was determined that this continual reporting of black men 
                        as criminals was racist and could drive white people and broader society to fear all black men. 

                    </p>
                    <p class="blog_content-p">
                        Fast forward to today, and stories like this are far more rare. Is that because the crime went away? Perhaps in part, but 
                        it is also true that new media rarely mention that a suspect is black. What stories are covered with national attention 
                        are ones where black people are killed by police or white men. What is covered is any story that promotes the belief that 
                        white, conservative men are racist and a threat to both black people and the very democratic republic under which we live. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="blog_content-p">
                        In both instances, the media is pushing stories that paint a narrative. Woke Ideology pushes a prescription that we should 
                        not report on certain stories a certain way because it could lead to discrimination against a racial minority, and 
                        historically marginalized group; however, it is acceptable and good to do the inverse because white men have privilege in 
                        society and this drives equity while also calling attention to a perceived, actual threat to society.

                    </p>
                    <p class="blog_content-p">
                        Another example, taking it away from media, suggests that members of the LGBTQIA+ community have been marginalized through 
                        a society that is “hetero-normative”. Their sexuality is not normalized throughout society, so educators have begun 
                        placing LGBTQIA+ themes and lessons into schools. Whether this is teaching about homosexual sex acts, Gender Ideology, or 
                        just having books and drag story hour and performances, this has crept into classrooms across the country. 

                    </p>
                    <p class="blog_content-p">
                        Children at young ages are taught that they might feel like the opposite gender and that is alright because maybe they 
                        really are. Schools will help children transition without parental knowledge and asking for pronouns is normalized. 

                    </p>
                    <p class="blog_content-p">
                        Sexual education, initially teaching teenagers about the biological reality of procreation and how that functions, are now 
                        taught sexual acts for pleasure, including homosexual sex acts. This, as a push to break hetero-normativity, but with what 
                        down-stream effects?
                    </p>
                    <p class="blog_content-p">
                        We can see this with the discussion of the gender pay gap, and laws being pushed to equalize pay. One prominent example of 
                        this is with women’s soccer. The women’s soccer team pushed for equal pay to the men’s team, despite having accepted a 
                        contract with higher, guaranteed minimums and benefits. They pushed hard enough and got it, which means that if they split 
                        the winnings of the men’s team with the women’s team. Now, the men’s winnings are naturally higher because men’s soccer 
                        brings in significantly higher money throughout the year and is far more popular. Additionally, the men’s team is far 
                        better at the sport and could easily beat the women’s team, but all this does not matter in the eyes of the women’s 
                        players because they have won more championships and are doing the same job. Pushing the levers of the system to force 
                        equal pay and outcomes regardless of a differential in ability or outcome of revenue generated. 

                    </p>
                    <p class="blog_content-p">
                        Now, is anything said about how women are not supporting women’s sports en masse? No. This applies to women’s basketball 
                        as well. Why are women not supporting women’s sports like men support men’s sports? Instead, it is put on men for being 
                        misogynistic for not supporting women’s sports as a reason for the lower revenue, and structural discrimination against 
                        women for the lower pay. 

                    </p>
                    <p class="blog_content-p">
                        A brief aside: because discrimination against women is also covered through modern feminism, not linking it to Woke 
                        Ideology is understandable. I include it because it is all similar and recognize with modern “intersectionality”, these 
                        two often cross.

                    <p class="blog_content-p">
                        I will not attempt to demonstrate all of these principals in action with a modern TV series adaptation of my favorite 
                        fantasy series, Wheel of Time. This series encapsulates most aspects and examples I have provided, and will get back to 
                        other examples afterward.

                    <p class="blog_content-p">
                        The Wheel of Time is a series written by Robert Jordan and was released in the 1990’s and early 2000’s. The main 
                        characters were three young men and is a coming of age story with many themes of masculinity, female empowerment, men 
                        and women working together to build society, male and female dynamics, and much more.

                        The television series is an adaptation headed by showrunner Rafe Judkins. Rafe is a self proclaimed feminist man who is 
                        also gay. There is nothing wrong with that specifically, but it is this identity which drives many of the decisions to 
                        greatly change the tv series from the books. He is quoted as saying with regards to feminism in the series,

                        “One of the things about the books is that they were probably quite, quite feminist in the ‘90s when they came out, and so 
                        I want to stay true to that and make them feel feminist for today,” Judkins says. “I think if we took some of the things 
                        that happened in the books and put them on screen today, they would not feel as feminist. There’s a 30-year gap between 
                        when those [first books] came out and the [series] end.”<a href="https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/amazon-the-wheel-of-time-embraces-female-focused-fantasy/" class="reference-link">1</a>

                        he says.

                        Right out of the gate, the lore was changed to promote the idea that the Dragon Reborn could be a woman, despite the original 
                        Dragon being a man. In the books, it was known that the Dragon would be reborn as a man that could channel, and that was part 
                        of what made the prophecy of his rebirth such a scary thing, since men that can channel are doomed to go insane and were 
                        responsible for the breaking of the world. By changing this, it opens it up for the savior to be a woman, but changes both the

                        Rafe Judkins took parts of New Spring, a prequel book, and expanded that to be a full blown relationship, including sex 
                        scenes, in season one of the show. Moiraine and Siuan Sanche were said to be “pillow friends” in New Spring. While this 
                        has been stated to often mean a sexual relationship by Robert Jordan.

                        "Pillow friends are not just good friends. Oh, they are that, too, but they also get hot and sweaty together and muss up 
                        the sheets something fierce. By the way, pillow friends is a term used in the White Tower. The same relationship between 
                        men or women elsewhere would be called something else, depending on the country." <a href="https://wot.fandom.com/wiki/Pillow_friends" class="reference-link">4</a>

                    <p class="blog_content-p">
                        However, in the main series, which is what is being adapted, Moiraine has a relationship with Thom that is implied, and 
                        Siuan with Garyth Bryne. Certainly it can be said that Siuan and Moiraine are more open sexually and former lovers, it 
                        was never displayed in the main book series. It is brought into the show series because of Woke Ideology pushing the idea 
                        that LGBTQIA relationships are under represented in television, and so changes must be made to the series to show this 
                        relationship. 
                    </p> 
                    <p class="blog_content-p">
                        Further, it was mentioned in the books that some green Ajah Aes Sedai have multiple Warders and that they sometimes sleep 
                        with them. It was not specifically stated that they have threesomes with them, nor was it mentioned that the Warders were 
                        gay for each other. Rafe Judkins shows this clearly happening in season one with Alanna going to sleep with her two 
                        Warders, both portrayed as particularly feminine acting, gay men. In episode one of season two, Alanna can again be seen 
                        as having a threesome with her Warders. 
                    </p> 
                    <p class="blog_content-p">
                        Because this was not seen directly in the books, inserting it into the series means that new scenes need to be created to 
                        show this activity, which means scenes that are in the books have to be cut to make room. This is done because Rafe 
                        Judkins is inserting his own Woke Ideology into the series, placing an importance on representing gay and polyamorous 
                        relationships in the show based on historic lack of representation in television, as well as historic discrimination 
                        against people that engage in this kind of activity.

                    <p class="blog_content-p">
                        Many of the characters in the Wheel of Time television series are race swapped from what they were in the book. We know 
                        this because there are notes on who Robert Jordan envisioned to play the characters if it were to be adapted. This 
                        includes main characters such as Perrin, Egwene, and Nyneave.

                        Let me be clear, I am not completely opposed to race swapping, though I am generally against it. But I point this out as 
                        being done due to Woke Ideology. The book series was racially diverse, as already stated by Rafe Judkins; however, it was 
                        “important” to make it even more racially diverse, presumably, due to historic under-representation of racial minorities 
                        in fantasy televisions shows, particularly as main characters.

                        When I first heard about this movie, I knew at the time that there would be no race swapping going on. This story is based on African 
                        culture. It is set in an African setting, with an all black cast of characters. Recently, the cast was partially announced. The People.com 
                        article is from January 27th, 2025. And as I suspected, the entire cast matches the description of the characters much closer than 
                        what we see with Wheel of Time. But I will let you decide.

                        While I will not go into the <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6779038/">of the casting</a>, though there are more, I will just note that they are all 
                        black. Now, to be clear here, that is how they should be. The books is written by a black woman, based on African 
                        culture, with characters that are all black. The casting should match character descriptions. But I find it odd 
                        that the casting of white characters, from stories written by white authors, set in more European setting, are race-swapped 
                        for black, Asian, or anything other than white. But when there is an opportunity to add more diversity to a story set 
                        in any other setting, fidelity to the source material and character descriptions are respected.

                        The Wheel of Time is set in a time period where travel is on horses. For 1,000+ years, technology has been restricted 
                        to a Medieval to early Renaissance period. This would mean, in a highly isolated area like the Two Rivers, where the 
                        main characters are from, there would be racial/ethnic homogeneity. Even if there are a few outliers, such as Rand, 
                        who was of Aiel descent, generally speaking, people all look of the same race and ethnicity.

                        Rafe Judkins changed the racial makeup of the Two Rivers, where it looks highly racially diverse, including the main 
                        cast. So now, the isolation of the Two Rivers becomes hard to explain and must be changed.

                        Cairhien is known for short, white people, but in the show, the nobility looks highly diverse. This would not be the 
                        case, even if the urban population was, because societies at the time this is based on would commonly restrict blatant 
                        foreigners from the noble class.

                        As can be seen above, many of the main characters are race swapped and as Rafe Judkins has stated, it was important to 
                        drive diversity in the casting of the show, despite the books already being very diverse. Even if pushing the diversity 
                        breaks logic for the period of time it is set in and contradicts the vision of the author.

                    <p class="blog_content-p">
                        Lan, in the books, is a very stoic character. He is known for not showing emotion, being very stern, and demonstrating 
                        a strength in standing up to both Aes Sedai, and others, while teaching the main boys how to fight. In the show, he 
                        does not teach anyone. He is berated consistently by Moiraine, and he has an entire episode dedicated to him being 
                        emotionally available for a hurting Warder and when the Warder ends up committing suicide, he falls to his knees and 
                        cries at the funeral. In season two, he is further berated by Moiraine while trying to express his feelings about her 
                        pushing him away.

                    <p class="blog_content-p">
                        Lan does not act the way he did in the book, demonstrating what would be considered today as toxic masculinity. 
                        Meanwhile, all of the women in the show are stoic and hold their emotions. This is a reversal of how men and women have 
                        been portrayed historically in cinema and books.While women were shown in the books to be stoic at times, changing the 
                        men in the television series is a departure from the books and is done to push an ideal of women as strong and stoic 
                        while men are emotionally vulnerable and sensitive.

                        Lord Aglemar is another man in the series to get this treatment. In the books, he is displayed as being understanding 
                        of the power and position of Moiraine. When she arrives in Fal Dara, he asks for her help, takes her objections 
                        seriously, and offers to send men with her to protect her since her mission is more important.

                        In the show, he is changed to be dismissive of Moiraine and his sister, boarding on straight out misogyny and is put 
                        in his place by Moiraine. He is then later killed in a large battle after not listening to his sister and asking the 
                        White Tower for help in the coming battle.

                        Everything in his scenes could have remained the same other than the dialogue, and he could have come across as 
                        closer to the feminist ideal. But instead he is a man in a position of power and is portrayed as incompetent and 
                        misogynistic because Woke Ideology suggests that men in power have oppressed women historically, so it must be 
                        shown as the case and that it leads to ruin.

                        and stubbornness, in the show, he is shown as being weak to the temptation of a woman and succumbing to her domination.

                        Emond’s Field with Tam. We can see that the show is giving more prominence to a trivial part in the books involving a 
                        female character and taking away prominence and importance from the lead, male character. 
                    </p> 
                    <p class="blog_content-p">
                        Rather than a scene where Perrin takes down a White Cloak with his ax, we get a made up scene where Egwene channels 
                        to break out of her bonds, and then she takes down a White Cloak with a dagger. Rather than a scene to make a male character
                        look strong, we give that to a female character.
                    </p> 
                    <p class="blog_content-p">
                        Rather than a scene where Rand appears at the large battle at Tarwin’s Gap and uses the One Power to destroy the 
                        Trolloc army and save the Sheinarans, we get Egwene and Nyneave linking with Amalisa to destroy the entire Trolloc 
                        army, after all of the Sheinarans fail at Tarwin’s Gap. Rather than having a scene where the lead, male character looks 
                        strong, the claim is that the women needed something to do, so the scene was given to them.
                    </p> 
                    <p class="blog_content-p">
                        In season two, we do not get Mat and Rand chasing after the horn. We do not get much focus on any actions of theirs, 
                        but rather we are treated to many made up scenes that show a sympathetic back story for Liandrin, Verin being a detective, 
                        and made up story for Moiraine, including a character that was not in the main books, Moiraine’s sister. 
                    </p> 
                    <p class="blog_content-p">
                        We are repeatedly shown and told that women do evil things because they are driven to by the men in their lives, whether 
                        it be Lews Therrin not returning the love of Lanfear, or Liandrin turning to evil because of the horrible treatment as a 
                        little girl, being impregnated and having a son who is then dying. Meanwhile, Rand spends both seasons primarily being 
                        pushed into his events by a more competent woman, mostly Moiraine. It is revealed in season two that Moiraine orchestrated 
                        Rand going to Cairhien, and Logain being moved to a sanitarium there, all so Rand could learn to channel from Logain, 
                        despite him no longer being able to channel and show Rand anything.

                        In episode seven of season two, we have an entire dream sequence with Mat, which portrays him as doing potentially evil 
                        things, killing the ones he loves and then himself. This seemingly will replace the point where he is hanged in Ruidean 
                        after going through the ter-angreal arch and he gains the knowledge of all of his past lives. A better scene that builds 
                        Mat as a character is replaced with one that shows Mat as potentially evil.

                    <p class="blog_content-p">
                        You can see where we have the scenes about the boys degraded from the books to portray them as less competent, and 
                        potentially evil. Meanwhile, we have scenes given to the women that show them as virtuous, powerful, and having 
                        backstory reasons for doing bad things.

                    <h3>Conclusions</h3>
                    <p class="blog_content-p">
                        Rafe Judkins, Amazon Studios, and most of those involved appear to be using the Wheel of Time property to advance modern 
                        narratives and morals that they see as superior to what was contained in the source material. Female goodness and supremacy, 
                        toxic masculinity, the inherent nature of men in power abusing their power, and representation of historically marginalized 
                        groups including women, black and Asian people, and LGBTQIA people within a story where they were not originally.
                    </p> 
                    <p class="blog_content-p">
                        Rafe Judkins has as much as admitted that his intention is to do this, so I do not think it is even in question as to whether 
                        this is happening.
                    </p> 
                    <p class="blog_content-p">
                        All of this is done through a lens of historical marginalization of different groups. All of this is done to push these 
                        groups into prominent positions within the show/story. And I am not opposed to stories that focus on this, but to take the 
                        work of someone else and co-opt it to push this agenda is wrong. There are many stories out there that are written with these 
                        lenses applied from the outset, and if there are not, a talented writer could develop his/her own story. 
                    </p> 
                    <p class="blog_content-p">
                        The question remains if going this route will be a success. Fans of the books can break down into a couple of different 
                        categories. There are those that are fans of the books and do not want substantial changes to the source material; I fall 
                        into this group. We understand that changes are necessary because of format and time, but we generally think that those 
                        changes should be as minimal as possible. 
                    </p> 
                    <p class="blog_content-p">
                        Then there are fans where they like the story in the books, but they are fine with the changes because they are in line 
                        with their world view and found certain things about the books problematic during our modern age. 
                    </p> 
                    <p class="blog_content-p">
                        The final group may recognize the problems, but they are just happy to get any Wheel of Time content. 
                    </p> 
                    <p class="blog_content-p">
                        The biggest question is, with all of these groups, how many changes can you make until you lose enough fans that viewership 
                        numbers substantially drop?

                    </p> 
                    <p class="blog_content-p">
                        Wheel of Time season two scored 515 million minutes watched for their premier three episode drop. That was a 55.7% drop from 
                        the premier of season one.<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WoTshow/comments/16v1ljr/analysis_of_wot_s2_nielsen_numbers_compared_to/" class="reference-link">5</a>  T
                        his means that they have lost a substantial amount of the audience they had from season one. 
                        If much of that was disaffected book fans, how do you gain them back? If it were just woke messaging, that would be one thing, 
                        but the changes here are legion and one cannot simply get back to the books from where the series has gone. 
                    </p> 
                    <p class="blog_content-p">
                        Will the woke messaging and changes pay off? I do not think so, but we shall see. Clearly the show has gained non-book fans 
                        that like the messaging that has been inserted. 

                    </p> 
                    <p class="blog_content-p">
                        From a broader, societal perspective, how does the inserting of woke messaging into mainstream culture impact us? Does the demonization 
                        of straight white people, particularly men, help society? Certainly, black people have faced plenty of societal challenges throughout 
                        the history of the United States. Does it serve us to bring straight white men down to the level of similar societal challenges? Would 
                        it not be better to try to erase the stigmas others have faced? Right now it appears that we are trying to bring straight white men 
                        down, while attempting to erase the stigmas for others, but creating more conflict and animosity among all groups.

                        The 2020 Black Lives Matter protests and riots did not help the image of Black people among conservative white individuals. Nor is the 
                        current protesting and looting that is impacting large cities around the country after the decrease in funding for police forces in 
                        most of those major areas.

                        Many Universities push programs to get women into STEM subjects, typically dominated by men. Meanwhile, women vastly outnumber men 
                        on college campuses, to the tune of almost 60% women to 40% men. Women also dominate in the field of education, where it can be hard 
                        at times for young male students to even encounter a male teacher.6  We continue to see pushes to drive more female participation in 
                        the workforce and education, but no push in society to help men. What we see instead is a rise in lonely, disaffected men that retreat 
                        into self loathing and online forums, or lash out at society. 

                    </p> 
                    <p class="blog_content-p">
                        If you are a straight white man in modern U.S. society, and you see from early childhood, women educating you, pushing a feminist 
                        message of the future is female… And then, as you get older, you are taught all about how your ancestors oppressed the native people 
                        of this land, enslaved the ancestors of the black people you encounter, oppressed all the ancestors of the women you encounter, 
                        oppressed all of the LGBTQIA people that your encounter, what impact does that have on you? Then, every television show and movie 
                        you see pushes this message. Your role models are taken, you may not have a father figure, and you are told that every system that 
                        was set up by your forebearers is designed to oppress everyone else.. You are a privileged, racist, misogynist, homophobe, transphobe, 
                        bigot that must repent for being born white, male, and straight. And if you fight this labeling, it is reinforcement of those labels 
                        being true. 

                    </p> 
                    <p class="blog_content-p">
                        In the end, I think more animosity is being generated. People are aligning against each other, women against men, racial minorities against
                        white people in the U.S., queer people against straight people. Can we continue like this? Bringing it back to Wheel of Time, will the show continue
                        if it shows a large number of the book fans that ideology is more important than staying true to the story they love? Early numbers seem to 
                        suggest no, but we shall see. If you stand against the changes, it is because you are a bigot, those that defend the show say. But how 
                        does that help retain your audience, telling those that complain that they are only doing it because they are bigots? Will they have enough
                        new fans to make up that difference? Is dislike of the woke messaging the only reason book fans turn away? I make the case that no, that is not the case
                        in my season one review, and will make that case again in my season two review. 
                    </p> 
                    <p class="blog_content-p">
                        In short, this show is still bad with season two released. and woke ideology continues to be ever present, and part of the reason that 
                        it is not good.
