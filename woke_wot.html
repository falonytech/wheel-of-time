                        Definition of Woke and Woke Ideology
                    </p>
                    <h3>Woke</h3>
                    <p class="blog_content-p">
                        To be awakened to the systemic oppression and discrimination throughout society’s social, cultural, and political 
                        institutions and systems. To be aware of how the functioning of these institutions and systems oppresses marginalized 
                        groups both historically and in the present.
                    </p>
                    <p class="blog_content-p">
                        To give a couple of examples:
                    </p>
                    <p class="blog_content-p">
                        Black people suffer from racism baked into the foundation of the culture and laws of the United States, and this baked in 
                        racism impacts their education, how they are treated by the law, career opportunities, etc. White Supremacy is pushed 
                        culturally, and dominates through the teaching of history, the movies that are made, the standards of beauty, the stories 
                        that are told, the music that is popular. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="blog_content-p">
                        Women have suffered throughout history, not being allowed to vote, own land, have jobs outside the home, married off to 
                        men, and generally viewed as second class citizens. Society, and all cultural, political, societal institutions and 
                        structures are patriarchal in nature and designed to oppress women. Women are pressured to fit into a gendered stereotype 
                        from birth, which places them in a supporting role to men, pushing them to earn less, focus on having babies and managing 
                        a home rather than focusing on a career and being a head of a household. 

                    </p>
                    <h3>Woke Ideology</h3>
                    <p class="blog_content-p">
                        Given the definition of Woke, Woke Ideology is the solutions and  the prescriptions designed to compensate and/or correct 
                        for the historic and current inequities present in said societal and political structures. 

                    </p>
                    <p class="blog_content-p">
                        This is where I will expand a little further in my examples, and they can be found throughout society. Woke Ideology sees 
                        the inequities and the root causes of these inequities throughout all facets of society, and so the prescriptions are 
                        pushed all throughout society. 

                    </p>
                    <p class="blog_content-p">
                        First example is the news media. News, for years, has been viewed primarily as an institution that reports the facts with 
                        as little bias as possible, and let the consumer of the news make a determination on what they believe. While this was not 
                        always the case, going back further when news papers were far more ideological, there was a change. Fast forward to today, 
                        and new media, regardless of format, is used as a vehicle for political messaging. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="blog_content-p">
                        In the 1990’s and early 2000’s, local news and national news frequently reported on crimes stories committed by black men. 
                        The nightly news was filled with these stories. Eventually, it was determined that this continual reporting of black men 
                        as criminals was racist and could drive white people and broader society to fear all black men. 

                    </p>
                    <p class="blog_content-p">
                        Fast forward to today, and stories like this are far more rare. Is that because the crime went away? Perhaps in part, but 
                        it is also true that new media rarely mention that a suspect is black. What stories are covered with national attention 
                        are ones where black people are killed by police or white men. What is covered is any story that promotes the belief that 
                        white, conservative men are racist and a threat to both black people and the very democratic republic under which we live. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="blog_content-p">
                        In both instances, the media is pushing stories that paint a narrative. Woke Ideology pushes a prescription that we should 
                        not report on certain stories a certain way because it could lead to discrimination against a racial minority, and 
                        historically marginalized group; however, it is acceptable and good to do the inverse because white men have privilege in 
                        society and this drives equity while also calling attention to a perceived, actual threat to society.

                    </p>
                    <p class="blog_content-p">
                        Another example, taking it away from media, suggests that members of the LGBTQIA+ community have been marginalized through 
                        a society that is “hetero-normative”. Their sexuality is not normalized throughout society, so educators have begun 
                        placing LGBTQIA+ themes and lessons into schools. Whether this is teaching about homosexual sex acts, Gender Ideology, or 
                        just having books and drag story hour and performances, this has crept into classrooms across the country. 

                    </p>
                    <p class="blog_content-p">
                        Children at young ages are taught that they might feel like the opposite gender and that is alright because maybe they 
                        really are. Schools will help children transition without parental knowledge and asking for pronouns is normalized. 

                    </p>
                    <p class="blog_content-p">
                        Sexual education, initially teaching teenagers about the biological reality of procreation and how that functions, are now 
                        taught sexual acts for pleasure, including homosexual sex acts. This, as a push to break hetero-normativity, but with what 
                        down-stream effects?
                    </p>
                    <p class="blog_content-p">
                        We can see this with the discussion of the gender pay gap, and laws being pushed to equalize pay. One prominent example of 
                        this is with women’s soccer. The women’s soccer team pushed for equal pay to the men’s team, despite having accepted a 
                        contract with higher, guaranteed minimums and benefits. They pushed hard enough and got it, which means that if they split 
                        the winnings of the men’s team with the women’s team. Now, the men’s winnings are naturally higher because men’s soccer 
                        brings in significantly higher money throughout the year and is far more popular. Additionally, the men’s team is far 
                        better at the sport and could easily beat the women’s team, but all this does not matter in the eyes of the women’s 
                        players because they have won more championships and are doing the same job. Pushing the levers of the system to force 
                        equal pay and outcomes regardless of a differential in ability or outcome of revenue generated. 

                    </p>
                    <p class="blog_content-p">
                        Now, is anything said about how women are not supporting women’s sports en masse? No. This applies to women’s basketball 
                        as well. Why are women not supporting women’s sports like men support men’s sports? Instead, it is put on men for being 
                        misogynistic for not supporting women’s sports as a reason for the lower revenue, and structural discrimination against 
                        women for the lower pay. 

                    </p>
                    <p class="blog_content-p">
                        A brief aside: because discrimination against women is also covered through modern feminism, not linking it to Woke 
                        Ideology is understandable. I include it because it is all similar and recognize with modern “intersectionality”, these 
                        two often cross. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>Wheel of Time</h3>
                    <p class="blog_content-p">
                        I will not attempt to demonstrate all of these principals in action with a modern TV series adaptation of my favorite 
                        fantasy series, Wheel of Time. This series encapsulates most aspects and examples I have provided, and will get back to 
                        other examples afterward.
