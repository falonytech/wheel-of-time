                    <p class="blog_content-p">As the year winds down, I will cover what I am using heading into 2026. I am a bit 
                        of a tech enthusiast, so I like to keep my tech up-to-date, though I am not rich and do not have the money 
                        to spend on the newest and nicest of anything. 
                    </p>

                    <h3>Desktop</h3>
                    <p class="blog_content-p">My desktop PC has gone through an upgrade over 2025. Almost the entire internals are 
                        new, excepting maybe the case and the case fans.  </p>
                    <p class="blog_content-p">Key Specs at a Glance:</p>
                    <ul class="blog_content-ol">
                        <li><strong>Processor:</strong> Ryzen 5 7600X 6-core CPU</li>
                        <li><strong>RAM:</strong> CORSAIR VENGEANCE RGB DDR5 RAM 32GB (2x16GB) 6000MHz</li>

                    <p class="blog_content-p">Seeing as RAM and graphics cards are likely to get price increases over the next 
                        year at least, I made the upgrade at the right time. While my desktop is not the most impressive gaming 
                        rig in the world, it should handle what I play for the foreseeable future on the 32 inch 2k gaming monitor 
                        I have it hooked up to. </p>
                    <h3>Laptops</h3>
                    <p class="blog_content-p">My first and newest laptop is the Acer NitroV 16” that I reviewed <a href="Acer-Nitro.html">here</a>. I am not going 
                        to go into detail here since I did a review of it, but some basic specs: </p>
                    <ul class="blog_content-ol">
                        <li><strong>Processor:</strong> AMD Ryzen 7 8845HS Octa-Core</li>
                        <li><strong>RAM:</strong> 16GB DDR5 SDRAM @ 5600 MHz</li>
                        <li><strong>GPU:</strong> NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 Mobile 8GB VRAM</li>

                    <p class="blog_content-p">This laptop has been great so far and has handled everything I have thrown at it, 
                        including very modern games like Kingdom Come Deliverance II. </p>
                    <p class="blog_content-p">The laptop I prefer to work on, and do anything that is not gaming, is the trusty, 
                        old Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 6 from 2018. </p>
                    <ul class="blog_content-ol">
                        <li><strong>Processor:</strong> Intel Core™ i7-8550U CPU @ 1.80GHz</li>

                    <p class="blog_content-p">I configured this laptop to what I wanted when purchasing it directly from Lenovo. 
                        This has become my main laptop for years and still holds up. I currently have it running 
                        Fedora 43 KDE and it has run Linux since the day I got it. I never booted Windows on it, not even day one 
                        when I got it. I had a USB stick with Ubuntu ready and wiped it immediately. Almost all of my web development, 
                        limited as that has been, has been done with this machine. I have built my desk setup with connecting this 
                        laptop through Thunderbolt connection to the Lenovo ThinkPad docking station. It still feels just as good 
                        to use as the day I got it and works just as well as my other two computers. While it is getting long in 
                        the tooth, and I cannot run Windows 11 on it, with Linux on this I do not feel a need to upgrade from it 
                        yet. Any upgrade is a want at this point.  </p>
                    <h3>Tablet</h3>
                    <p class="blog_content-p">I am currently using an 11”  iPad Air M1with 64Gb of storage. I was gifted this 
                        one used by my brother who upgraded to a newer model. The tablet still runs well and is a large step up 
                        from the A13 iPad I was using before. </p>
                    <h3>Phone</h3>
                    <p class="blog_content-p">The phone is a Google Pixel 9 Pro. I decided to stick with a Pixel, which was upgraded 
                        from a Pixel 6. I enjoy having a phone that stays up-to-date with the latest software without waiting for 
                        some other company to release their own version of the OS with whatever skin and BS applications they need 
                        to push through. It works fine, no complaints here. 

                    </p>
                    <p class="blog_content-p">In 2026, my brother is getting a new MacBook Pro with an M4 chip and likely giving 
                        me his older M1 Pro model. If I get that, I will likely use that for a while and see if it is something I 
                        would switch to on a more permanent basis. For now though, I am good on tech and should be able to make it 
                        through 2026 without a major tech purchase. If I get anything, it would just be a newer iPad Air with more 
                        storage, in part so I can gift the older one to one of my sons. The iPads they are using are beyond getting 
                        updates, so eventually some of the applications they use will stop working; some already have. But we shall 
                        see what 2026 hold in store and if even iPads start to see price hikes because of RAM price increases.
