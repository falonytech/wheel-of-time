          <p class="topic-card-paragraph">Season three is finally here and the first episode is about as bad as one could expect. I did not see a single scene taken from the books and significant 
            damage continues to be done to many of hte characters. Rand does not appear to have much in the way of agency, Moiraine is colluding with Lanfear, and Elayne and Avienda are now lesbian lovers. Additionally, the Black Ajah is complete outed, recognized, and then not even thought twice about after a day. I do not have faith that the rest of the season will be any more faithful to the books.

          <p class="topic-card-paragraph">Here I attempt to define what I mean when I use the terms Woke and Woke Ideology. I then use the Wheel of Time, seasons one and two, 
            to provide examples of how Woke Ideology has crept into society and entertainment.
