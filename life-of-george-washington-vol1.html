            <h3 class="blog_content-date">December 17, 2025</h3>

            <p class="blog_content-p">I recently finished the first volume of Washington Irving’s <em>Life of George Washington</em>. Reading a biography written in the 1850s offers a unique perspective; it lacks the presentism of modern history and feels much closer to the legendary atmosphere of the founding era.</p>

            <p class="blog_content-p">Here is a summary of Washington’s journey from a young surveyor to the Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army.</p>

            <h3 class="blog_content-subheading">Roots and Early Ambitions</h3>
            <p class="blog_content-p">Irving begins by tracing the Washington lineage back to the landed gentry of Norman England and William the Conqueror. The family eventually settled in Westmoreland County, Virginia, in 1657. George was the eldest child of Augustine and Mary Washington’s marriage.</p>

            <p class="blog_content-p">His education was practical—focusing on writing and bookkeeping—but his real education came from his elder brother, Lawrence. Through Lawrence’s military service, George developed an early, burning desire for a life of martial honor.</p>

            <h3 class="blog_content-subheading">The Wilderness and the &quot;Forest Meta&quot;</h3>
            <p class="blog_content-p">The narrative follows Washington’s early career as a surveyor in the Ohio region, which served as his introduction to the harsh realities of the American frontier. His early military ventures were a trial by fire:</p>

            <ul class="blog_content-ol">
                <li><strong>Early Defeat:</strong> After attempting to fortify a position against the French without adequate support, Washington suffered an early defeat and temporarily retired to Mount Vernon.</li>
                <li><strong>Braddock’s Blunder:</strong> Washington returned to service under General Braddock. In a classic historical tragedy, Braddock refused to listen to Washington’s advice regarding provincial warfare. Braddock’s insistence on traditional European formations led to a disastrous defeat because he failed to adapt to the &quot;meta&quot; of forest fighting.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="blog_content-subheading">The Spark of Revolution</h3>
            <p class="blog_content-p">As the book progresses, the focus shifts from the frontier to the political theater. Irving details the growing friction between the colonies and King George III, specifically regarding revenue and taxation. The Stamp Act and the Tea Act served as the catalysts for the Boston Tea Party.</p>

            <p class="blog_content-p">As the British began seizing ammunition and locking down Boston, the colonies were pushed toward open resistance. Washington, now a veteran and a respected Virginian, attended both Continental Congresses. Choosing the side of the revolution was a heavy decision that placed him at odds with many of his close friends, yet his conviction remained steadfast.</p>

            <h3 class="blog_content-subheading">Taking the Mantle</h3>
            <p class="blog_content-p">By 1775, the colonies began raising militias. Interestingly, even as late as June 1775, many in the Continental Congress believed they were only fighting the King’s ministers, not the Crown itself.</p>

            <p class="blog_content-p">On June 15, Washington was nominated as Commander-in-Chief. In a show of character that would define his public life, he accepted the position but refused a salary, asking only for the reimbursement of his expenses.</p>

            <h3 class="blog_content-subheading">The Turning Point: Bunker Hill</h3>
            <p class="blog_content-p">While Washington was preparing to take command, the Battle of Bunker Hill (largely fought on Breed’s Hill) took place. The British, viewing the American &quot;rebels&quot; with contempt, expected an easy victory. Instead, they lost over 1,000 men—more than double the American casualties.</p>

            <p class="blog_content-p">Though the British eventually took the hill, the Americans viewed it as a moral triumph. It proved that a volunteer militia could stand toe-to-toe with British Regulars.</p>

            <h3 class="blog_content-subheading">Conclusion</h3>
            <p class="blog_content-p">The volume concludes with Washington traveling to Cambridge to formally take command of the army. It’s a compelling look at a man being molded by his environment—from the woods of the Ohio Valley to the halls of Congress—preparing him for a task of monumental proportions.</p>

            <p class="blog_content-p">I’m looking forward to Volume II. There is something deeply refreshing about reading history through Irving’s 19th-century lens!</p>
