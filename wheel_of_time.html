                    <p class="blog_content-p">Let me start by giving the ending first on this one. I do not like the show. Amazon released season 
                        one of this series and I was excited to see the books brought to life. I figured that this was an opportunity for a more 
                        main stream audience to experience a story I have loved since high school. After the first four episodes, I knew that they 
                        were not doing the books justice, but I still held out some hope that the show would not venture too far from the books. 
                        By the end of the series, the story had ventured so far from the books that I no longer recognized the characters, and will 
                        not continue to watch the show heading into season two.  </p>
                    <p class="blog_content-p">
                        The changes are legion and range from changes to the mechanics and lore of the world, to deep changes to the characters 
                        and their motivations, to changes in the over all themes of the story, done for political reasons. The show and book series 
                        are now brought into the ongoing culture war between progressivism and conservatism. I will try to mostly stay away from some 
                        of the more ‘culture war’ aspects of the changes, but there are going to be some points where I cannot help but point some of 
                        it out. First, let me say that while some of the characters have been race swapped, this will not be an area I focus time on. 
                        While there are some places where the more diverse casting makes little sense, and I will point that out, overall I am less 
                        bothered by it and if a good actor is bringing the character to life, matching the looks describes in the book is a little 
                        less important. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="blog_content-p">
                        First, I plan on going through notes of each episode. I will attempt to point out changes as I see them, especially if they 
                        were not necessary. It will not be an exhaustive list, though I did just re-read book one of the series, I can’t remember every 
                        little detail. I will then summarize some of the critical changes to lore, mechanics, and characters. This will be kind of long, 
                        so forgive me, and I am not a professional writer, so don’t expect this to be written like I am one. What I think I will show is 
                        that when almost every scene is different than from the book, and is either wholy made up or carries such a different context 
                        and meaning, that it cannot be considered the same scene, it is difficult to call this an adaptation. When the world's lore, 
                        mechanics, and overall feel is so drastically different, it is difficult to consider this respectful of the source material and 
                        one must ask why were the changes made? I think it is more accurate to say that this is Rafe Judkin's Wheel of Time loosely based 
                        on the world that Robert Jordan built. This is the story Rafe Judkins wants to tell, not the one Robert Jordan told.
