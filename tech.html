          <a href="kobo.html"><h3>Kobo Clara Color</h3></a>
          <p>As an avid reader who has been locked into the Amazon Kindle ecosystem for years—most recently utilizing a reliable, 
            albeit aging, 10th-generation Paperwhite—I found myself facing a dilemma rooted in proprietary file formats and digital 
            rights management (DRM). While e-readers are fantastic for carrying a vast library of free, public-domain titles from 
            sources like Project Gutenberg, Amazon’s historically closed system created friction.</p>

          <p>In an effort to help my learning how to use Linux, I decided to take my Raspberry Pi and host this site on it. This 
            is a detailed account of that process.</p>

          <p>Season three is finally here and the first episode is about as bad as one could expect. I did not see a single scene 
            taken from the books and significant damage continues to be done to many of hte characters. Rand does not appear to 
            have much in the way of agency, Moiraine is colluding with Lanfear, and Elayne and Avienda are now lesbian lovers. 
            Additionally, the Black Ajah is complete outed, recognized, and then not even thought twice about after a day. I do 
            not have faith that the rest of the season will be any more faithful to the books.</p>
