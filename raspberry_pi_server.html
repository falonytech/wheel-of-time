                        I have used Linux for a long time, since 2004 or 2005 if I recall. While it has not always been my main operating system, 
                        I have always come back to it because I always run into a point where I had to reinstall Windows, but did not have a 
                        paid-for copy when I was younger. And while I have used Linux for such a long time, I never took the time to learn all 
                        the ins and outs. However, I have been taking courses on it recently and got to a couple of the lessons that I have wanted 
                        to learn more, SSH and zrchive files.  
                    </p>
                    <p class="blog_content-p">
                        I am completing these courses on a virtual image of Fedora MATE edition on a Windows gaming laptop because that computer has a 
                        higher core count and is more powerful. But needed a machine to SH into. I was setting up another virtual machine but was 
                        running into some issues there when I thought to myself, why not use the Raspberry Pi I have sitting around gathering dust. 
                        Once I got that working, one thing led to another and I was deep into reading guides on how to set up webservers and FTP servers 
                        on the Pi. I figured, there would be no better practice for what I was learning in the Linux course than practical application by 
                        transferring my site over to the Raspberry Pi and managing the machine remotely.  
                    </p>
                    <p class="blog_content-p">Below are three Youtube videos that I watched from Tony Teaches Tech that helped me get started. </p>

                    <p class="blog_content-p">To set up an FTP server, I then also used this <a href="https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-ftp/">Pimylifeup</a> guide.  
                    </p>
                    <p class="blog_content-p">I have been able to set up the FTP server and webserver, but I am still working on getting the domain name 
                        to point to the server. I will update this article when I get that working. </p>
                    <p class="blog_content-p">The Raspberry Pi I am using is a Raspberry Pi 4 with 4Gb of RAM and a 32Gb SD Card running Raspbian OS. I 
                        could see myself outgrowing this over the long-term because of storage space limitations; however, for right now I am just using 
                        this as a learning tool and do not have a reason to spend more money for something that will get very little traffic. </p>

                    <p class="blog_content-p">Overall, I am really enjoying learning about Linux and setting up the Raspberry Pi as a server. It has been 
                        a fun project and I am excited to see what else I can do with it. </p>
                    <p class="blog_content-p">
                        {Update} So I used the chatbot feature in support for netlify and received the following walkthrough to point the newly purchased domain
                        name to the Raspberry Pi server. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="blog_content-p">
                      If you purchased your domain through Netlify, it will be automatically configured to use Netlify DNS by default. To point your domain to 
                      a webserver you are hosting on a Raspberry Pi (i.e., an external server), you need to update the DNS records for your domain in the Netlify 
                      dashboard.
                    </p>
                    <p class="blog_content-p">
                        Here’s how you can do it:
                    </p>
                    <ol class="blog_content-ol">
                        <li>Go to Domain Management in your Netlify dashboard, navigate to Domain management for your site.</li>
                        <li>Find Your Domain. Your Netlify-purchased domain should already appear in the list of domains.</li>
                        <li>Edit DNS Records. 
                            <ul>
                                <li>Select your domain and go to the DNS records section. </li>
                                <li>You will need to create or update an A record to point to the public IP address of your Raspberry Pi webserver.</li>
                                <li>For example, if your Raspberry Pi’s public IP is 203.0.113.42, set:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Type: A</li>
                                        <li>Name: @</li>
                                        <li>Value: 203.0.113.42</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>If you want www.yourdomain.com to also point to your Raspberry Pi, add a CNAME or another A record as needed.</li>

                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Wait for DNS Propagation. DNS changes can take up to 48 hours to propagate globally.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p class="blog_content-p">I was easily able to follow these instructions and will report back once I see that it is working properly. If so, then
                        kudos to the chatbot that they utilize for guidance and this is a lot easier than I thought. And if this works, it is off to the races with managing 
                        my own site. 
                    </p>
